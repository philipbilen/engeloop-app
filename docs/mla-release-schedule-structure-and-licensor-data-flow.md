suggested title: mla-release-schedule-structure-and-licensor-data-flow

## Context
- You are refining Engeloop’s contracting model around a `Master Licence Agreement` (MLA) plus track-specific `Release Schedules`
- Current state is a single 8 page licence with all terms plus a Schedule A per track, which is heavy to redo for each release
- Goal is to:
  - Sign an MLA once per licensor as the evergreen legal framework
  - Use short Release Schedules per deal to capture track specific rights, term, territory, splits, advances, and publishing
  - Align this with ADA’s reality (UPC and ISRC not known at contract time) and Loudkult’s licensor onboarding workflow
- Context includes:
  - Engeloop licensing masters rather than acquiring ownership, but wanting perpetual licences with reversion safeguards
  - Operational need for catalog stability for both Engeloop and Loudkult (avoid expiring licences and admin churn)
  - Desire to treat the contract as a data structure that maps cleanly into your internal database and tools

## Key Decisions
- Use a single MLA per licensor instead of repeating full agreements
- MLA will:
  - Identify Label and Licensor with a structured `Parties` block
  - Define the core concepts (`Agreement`, `Recordings`, `Release Schedule`, `Catalog Number`, `Net Receipts`, etc.)
  - Set standard, non variable legal terms (grant of rights framework, accounting, warranties, data use)
  - Not fix any default label share, licensor pool, or royalty split values
- Use one Release Schedule per “deal” or set of Recordings
- Release Schedule will:
  - Identify the relevant Recordings and can include multiple mixes and configurations (radio edit, extended, etc.)
  - Reference the MLA and licensor
  - Set variable deal terms: Term, Territory, royalty model, splits, advances, recoupable costs, and any publishing
  - Optionally list one or more Catalog Numbers, but Catalog Number is not the identity of the Agreement
- Catalog Number usage
  - Decision: Catalog Number is a helper identifier and link to ADA, not the core ID of the Agreement
  - One Agreement can be associated with multiple Catalog Numbers (e.g. streaming plus Beatport configurations)
- Perpetual licence with reversion
  - Non negotiable operational principle: Engeloop licences masters in perpetuity
  - There will be reversion or termination triggers (e.g. failure to release, extended unavailability on major DSPs) so artists have a safety valve
- Licensor data capture
  - Licensor will explicitly type their own `legal name`, `PKA`, `postal address`, and `email` into the MLA via e signing form fields
  - That data becomes the confirmed source of truth for the `People` / `Licensor` records and Loudkult onboarding
- Licensor type
  - No separate template for companies is needed
  - Single MLA template will support `Licensor type: Individual / Company` with minor conditional fields (contact person for companies)
- Publishing treatment
  - Default: Engeloop does not administer publishing and the MLA will say so
  - Exception: for specific deals, an optional publishing section in the Release Schedule will describe Engeloop Publishing’s role and refer to a publishing split sheet

    - Engeloop may store and share details with the Distributor and royalty service providers (including Loudkult)
    - Notices can be sent to postal or email address and are deemed received when accessible
- Recitals and agreement structure
  - Recitals state:
    - Licensor owns or controls rights in sound recordings
    - Label releases and markets sound recordings
    - MLA sets standard terms
    - Variable terms are in Release Schedules
    - MLA plus each Release Schedule form a separate `Agreement` for the specified Recordings
  - Definitions include:
    - `Agreement`, `Artwork`, `Catalog Number`, `Distributor`, `MLA`, `Net Receipts`, `Recordings`, `Release Schedule`, `Royalty Split`, `Term`, `Territory`
  - Agreement structure section:
    - MLA is binding by itself
    - No licence for any Recording exists until a Release Schedule is fully executed
    - Each Release Schedule incorporates MLA by reference
    - In conflicts, Release Schedule terms prevail for that Agreement only
- Recordings and associated versions
  - `Recordings` are:
    - Core masters listed in the Release Schedule, and
    - `Associated Versions`:
      - Edits, radio edits, extended mixes, alternative versions
      - Created by or on behalf of the Licensor
      - Delivered as part of the same release campaign
      - With identical ownership and splits, unless otherwise agreed
  - Explicit exclusion:
    - Remixes with additional primary licensors are not included unless added via amendment or separate Release Schedule
- Grant of rights
  - Licensor grants Label an exclusive licence (unless otherwise stated in Release Schedule) to:
    - Reproduce the Recordings in digital formats
    - Distribute, transmit, and make available via all typical digital channels (streaming, downloads) through DSPs
    - Authorise Distributor and service providers to exercise these rights for distribution and marketing
    - Use names, approved likenesses, approved bios, and Artwork for promotion and exploitation of the Recordings
  - Exact `Term`, `Territory`, and `exclusivity` are defined per Release Schedule
  - Ownership of copyright in the Recordings does not transfer; rights remain licences only
  - Acknowledge Engeloop’s practice of obtaining rights on a perpetual basis, subject to reversion clauses
- Term and territory
  - For each Agreement:
    - `Term` and `Territory` come from Release Schedule
    - Perpetual licences must be clearly stated as such in the Release Schedule
    - Any reversion or termination triggers (e.g. failure to release, extended DSP unavailability) live in MLA and/or Release Schedule
- Accounting and payment
  - High level:
    - Label (and possibly Distributor) accounts to licensor for their share of `Net Receipts`
    - Statement frequency and payment timing to be specified (e.g. semi annual)
    - `Net Receipts` defined as Distributor receipts minus fees, taxes, mechanical royalties, and deductions at source
    - All variable economics per Agreement live in the Release Schedule:
      - Royalty model (label share vs licensor pool or direct split)
      - Percentage allocation between licensors
      - Advances and recoupable costs and recoupment bases
  - Distributor interaction:
    - Acknowledge that Distributor (Loudkult) may pay and report directly to licensors
    - Those payments and statements are treated as if made on behalf of the Label
- Release Schedule technical shape
  - References:
    - Label, Licensor, MLA date
  - Catalog Numbers and configurations:
    - Can list one or more Catalog Numbers (e.g. streaming product and Beatport extended mix)
    - Additional Catalog Numbers assigned later by Label or Distributor are deemed associated with the Agreement when recorded internally
  - Recordings:
    - List each Recording with `reference title`, `mix / version`, `notes`
    - Explicitly rely on MLA’s `Associated Versions` clause to capture edits etc. with same splits
  - Term and Territory:
    - Term start (e.g. release date or signature date)
    - Term duration (e.g. perpetual) and any renewals or reversions
    - Territory (typically `World`)
  - Financials:
    - Royalty model:
      - Option A: Label share and licensor pool
      - Option B: direct split of `Net Receipts`
    - Table of participants and their percentages within the licensor portion or directly of Net Receipts
    - Advance line with:
      - Amount
      - Recoupment source (e.g. licensor share under this Agreement only)
      - Cross collateralisation rules
    - Recoupable costs line:
      - Usually “None”
      - Otherwise, specific cost items and recoupment scope
  - Publishing:
    - Default clause: no publishing administration by the Label, writers handle their own publishing
    - Optional clause: Engeloop Publishing administers certain shares for this Agreement, referring to a separate publishing agreement and attached split sheet listing legal names, IPIs, and PROs
  - Signatures:
    - Label signature block for Algorhythm Ltd. t/a Engeloop Records
    - Licensor signature block with name and title/capacity (individual or company role)
- LaTeX and typesetting aspects
  - MLA is being compiled in LaTeX with:
    - `article` class, margins via `geometry`, spacing via `setspace`
    - `tabular` environments for structured Label details
    - Form like licensor block using underline rules `\rule{0.9\linewidth}{0.4pt}` and checkboxes with `\square`
  - Licensor block is designed to:
    - Look visually like a form
    - Be overlayed with e signing fields for direct licensor input
- E signing and data integration pattern
  - For MLA:
    - Label details are fixed in the template
    - Licensor fills all their fields directly in the e signing platform (DocuSign, Adobe, etc.)
    - After execution, licensor data is extracted and mapped into:
      - `People` table
      - `Artist` table (via PKA)
      - `Licensor` entity linked to MLA
  - For Release Schedule:
    - Label generates draft from internal app or Airtable like interface
    - E signing collects signatures and any necessary confirmations (but less raw data entry than MLA)
    - Executed Release Schedule creates an `Agreement` record linking licensor, masters, splits, catalog numbers, and ADA product configurations
- Ownership vs licensing and P line
  - Even though Engeloop licences masters rather than owning them outright, you can still put Engeloop on the `℗` line as the entity commercially exploiting the sound recording
  - Ownership of the master remains with the licensor, but exploitation control and branding for the term rests with Engeloop under the licence

## Next Steps
- Action items
- Finalise MLA wording
  - Fill in the placeholder sections for warranties, indemnities, limitation of liability, assignment, governing law, dispute resolution, and audit with jurisdiction appropriate language
  - Write explicit reversion / termination clause based on:
    - Failure to release within a certain timeframe
    - Prolonged unavailability on major DSPs
  - Decide on standard accounting cadence and minimum payment thresholds and add exact numbers
- Finalise Release Schedule template
  - Lock in a default structure for:
    - Recordings list
    - Catalog Numbers section
    - Term and Territory defaults
    - Royalty model language (including Engeloop’s standard label share vs licensor pool if you keep that structure)
    - Optional publishing section and how the publishing split sheet is referenced
- Align with internal data model and app
  - Map each MLA and Release Schedule field to corresponding database fields for `People`, `Artists`, `Licensors`, `Agreements`, `Masters`, `Releases`, `CatalogNumbers`
  - Decide how you will store the MLA reference for each licensor (e.g. `mla_id`, `mla_date`, and document path)
  - Define how an Agreement record will be represented and linked to ADA releases
- E signing implementation
  - Configure MLA template in your chosen e signing tool with:
    - Properly named text fields for each licensor datum
    - Radio group for licensor type
    - Signature blocks for both parties
  - Do test runs with dummy licensors to ensure data extraction into your database is reliable
- Communication and positioning
  - Draft a plain language explanation you can send to artists covering:
    - Why Engeloop uses a perpetual licence with reversion safeguards
    - How catalog stability benefits both label and artist
    - How MLA plus Release Schedule structure works in practice
- Outstanding questions
- Exact wording and thresholds for:
  - Reversion triggers (time to release, days of DSP unavailability, cure periods)
  - Statement frequency and minimum payment thresholds
- Whether to:
  - Embed any mention of specific distributors (e.g. Loudkult) by name, or keep the MLA fully distributor agnostic with a “currently including Loudkult AB” style reference
  - Allow non perpetual Terms in edge cases and how to handle that in Release Schedule language
- How deeply to integrate:
  - E signing platform and your internal app or database via API versus manual copy and paste in the first iteration
